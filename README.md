# CouchDB scriptless uploader

Needed to upload some files off an old Mac using a version of Netscape that only supported an intruigingly vintage JavaScript syntax. So…this is a super simple noscript form that let me get some StuffIt Deluxe–compressed zip files onto an OS X machine on the same LAN without messing with AFP/FTP.

Files are organized within any number of separate dropboxes, mostly because in CouchDB attachments are associated with documents and you can haz many documents.
