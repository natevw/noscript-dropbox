# CouchDB scriptless uploader

Needed to upload some files off an old Mac using a version of Netscape that only supported an intruigingly vintage JavaScript syntax. So…this is a super simple noscript form that let me get some StuffIt Deluxe–compressed zip files onto an OS X machine on the same LAN without messing with AFP/FTP.

At some point I'd like to extend this with list/show functions so it's actually  usable as a general purpose CouchApp, but for now you have to manually configure the target document and revno.
